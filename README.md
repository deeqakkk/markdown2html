## Setup and Run project locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Git installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deeqakkk/markdown2html.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate into the cloned repository(use two different terminal window):

```bash
cd markdown2html/frontend
cd markdown2html/backend
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install (for both backend & frontend)
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

Start the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
nodemon server
```

### Step 5: Access the Application

Once the server has started, you can access the application in your web browser.

### Step 6: Explore and Modify

You can now explore the project code and make modifications as needed. Any changes you make will be automatically reflected in the browser.

### Step 7: Build for Production (Optional)

If you want to build the project for production, you can run:

```bash
npm run build
```
This command will create an optimized build of the application in the `dist` directory.
